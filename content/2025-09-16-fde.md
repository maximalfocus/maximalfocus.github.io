### The FDE Model vs. Traditional SaaS

```mermaid
graph TD;
    subgraph "FDE Model (Problem-First)"
        direction TB
        A["Identify a High-Value<br>Problem Area"] --> B{"Partner with an Early Customer"};
        B --> C["FDEs Build Custom Solution On-site"];
        C --> D["Learn & Gather Insights"];
        D --> E["<strong>Generalize Solution into a<br>Scalable Product</strong>"];
        E --> F["Expand to Similar Customers"];
    end

    subgraph "Traditional SaaS Model (Solution-First)"
        direction TB
        G["<strong>Define a Scalable<br>Product First</strong>"] --> H{"Find Customers with that<br>Exact Problem"};
        H --> I["Sell & Onboard"];
        I --> J["Scale Sales & Marketing"];
    end
    
    %% Styling to emphasize key differences
    style A fill:#d2ffd2,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style G fill:#cde4ff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style E font-weight:bold
    style F font-style:italic

### The FDE "Unscalable at Scale" Loop

```mermaid
graph TD;
    subgraph "On-Site (Field)"
        direction TB
        A(Customer N);
        B["<strong>FDE Team Deploys</strong><br><em>(High-touch custom work)</em>"];
        C{Solves Specific Problem};
        A --> B --> C;
    end

    subgraph "At HQ (Core)"
        direction TB
        E[Core Product & Eng Team];
        F["<strong>Generalize & Improve the Platform</strong>"];
        E --> F;
    end
    
    C -- "Insights & Learnings" --> E;
    F -- "Improved Product (More Leverage)" --> B;

    %% Styling to highlight the key parts of the loop
    style F fill:#d2ffd2,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
    style B fill:#cde4ff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
```

### Information Flow: The Learning Company

```mermaid
graph TD;
    subgraph Customer Site
        direction TB
        A(Customer Needs & Problems);
        B(FDE Team);
        A --> B;
    end

    subgraph Company HQ
        direction TB
        C(Product Team);
        D(Engineering Team);
    end

    B -- "Real-time Feedback & Product Gaps" --> C;
    C -- "Generalized Requirements & Vision" --> D;
    D -- "New Product Features & Leverage" --> B;

    style B fill:#d2ffd2
    style C fill:#cde4ff
```

### The "Consulting Firm Trap"

```mermaid
graph TD;
    subgraph Ideal FDE Path
        direction TB
        A[Customer A Needs] --> B(FDE Builds Solution A);
        B --> C{Generalize Learnings};
        C --> D[Improve Core Platform];
        D --> E[Serve Customer B Faster/Cheaper];
    end

    subgraph "The Consulting Trap (Failure Path)"
        direction TB
        F[Customer A Needs] --> G(FDE Builds Solution A);
        H[Customer B Needs] --> I(FDE Builds Solution B);
        I --> J[Customer C Needs];
        J --> K(FDE Builds Solution C);
        G --> H;
        H --> J;
        J --> L(...);
        L --> M[No Scalable Product - Just Services];
    end

    style M fill:#ffcccc,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#d2ffd2
```

### The Cultural Divide: Field vs. HQ

```mermaid
graph LR;
    subgraph "Field (FDE Team)"
        direction LR
        A("<strong>Priority:</strong><br>Customer Success (Now!)");
        B("<strong>Incentive:</strong><br>Solve the immediate problem, whatever it takes.");
        C("<strong>View of HQ:</strong><br>'They're too slow and don't understand the real world.'");
        A --> B --> C;
    end

    subgraph "HQ (Core Product Team)"
        direction LR
        D("<strong>Priority:</strong><br>Scalability & Maintainability");
        E("<strong>Incentive:</strong><br>Generalize solutions to serve many customers.");
        F("<strong>View of Field:</strong><br>'They're building messy hacks and creating tech debt.'");
        D --> E --> F;
    end

    A -- "Requests for<br>Urgent, Custom Features" --> F;
    D -- "Pushback on<br>One-Off Solutions" --> C;

    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#9cf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```
