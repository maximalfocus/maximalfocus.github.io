### The Core Philosophy of "Create to Understand"

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["What I cannot create, I do not understand." - Richard Feynman] --> B{Two Paths to Knowledge};
    B --> C[Passive Learning];
    B --> D[Active Learning / Creation];
    C --> C1[Memorization];
    C --> C2[Surface-Level Familiarity];
    C --> C3[Difficulty Applying Knowledge];
    D --> D1[Deep Understanding];
    D1 --> D2[Ability to Explain Simply];
    D1 --> D3[Ability to Innovate & Solve Problems];
    D1 --> D4[Ability to Reconstruct from First Principles];

### The Feynman Technique for Learning

```mermaid

    subgraph The Feynman Technique
        A[Step 1: Choose a Concept] --> B{Step 2: Teach it to a Child};
        B --> C{Does the explanation use simple terms?};
        C -- Yes --> D[Step 4: Organize, Simplify & Review];
        C -- No --> E{Step 3: Identify Gaps in Understanding};
        E --> F[Go Back to Source Material];
        F --> B;
        D --> G([Deep Understanding Achieved]);
    end

### Philosophical Roots: From Vico to Feynman

```mermaid

    subgraph Intellectual Lineage
        A("Giambattista Vico (18th Century)") --> B["Verum Factum Principle <br> 'The true is the made'"];
        B --> C{"Truth is verified through creation or invention."};
        C --> D("Richard Feynman (20th Century)");
        D --> E["'What I cannot create, I do not understand.'"];
        E --> F{"Understanding is demonstrated by the ability to build, derive, and explain from scratch."};
    end
