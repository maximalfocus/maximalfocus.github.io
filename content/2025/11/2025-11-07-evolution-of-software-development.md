### The Evolution of Software Development

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph The Evolution of Software Development
        direction TB
        A["<b>1990s: The Foundation Years</b><br/>- Low-Level Programming (Assembly, C)<br/>- Manual memory management<br/>- Deep hardware knowledge required"]
        -->
        B["<b>Late 1990s - Early 2000s: The Object-Oriented Revolution</b><br/>- Rise of Java and C++<br/>- Abstraction through objects and behaviors<br/>- 'Write once, run anywhere'"]
        -->
        C["<b>2000s - 2010s: The Age of Frameworks & Libraries</b><br/>- Proliferation of open-source (GitHub)<br/>- Ruby on Rails, Django<br/>- Package managers (npm, pip)"]
        -->
        D["<b>2010s: The Cloud and API Era</b><br/>- Infrastructure as code (AWS, Azure, GCP)<br/>- Rise of microservices architecture<br/>- Shift from building to orchestrating services"]
        -->
        E["<b>2020s - Present: The AI Revolution</b><br/>- AI as a collaborator (25-30% of code AI-generated)<br/>- Developer as a conductor of AI tools<br/>- Focus on intention and quality assurance"]
        -->
        F["<b>2025-2030: The Imminent Future</b><br/>- Democratized Development<br/>- Focus on architecture, security, and system design<br/>- Anyone can build, professionals ensure quality"]
