### The Two-Tier System of AI Adoption

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph AI Watchers - The Passive Path
        direction TB
        A(Watch from the Sidelines) --> B(Let Ideas Gather Dust);
        B --> C(Complain About AI);
        C --> D{Risk of Displacement};
    end

    subgraph AI Builders - The Active Path
        direction TB
        E(Learn to Build with AI) --> F(Create New Value);
        F --> G(Build Real Apps & Companies);
        G --> H{Increased Opportunity};
    end

    style D fill:#ffcccb,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style H fill:#90ee90,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

### Builder Skills vs. Multiplier Skills

```mermaid

    A(AI Skill Sets)

    subgraph Multiplier Skills
        direction TB
        M1(Scale Existing Knowledge)
        M2(Compress Days of Work into Hours)
    end

    subgraph Builder Skills
        direction TB
        B1(Create New Things)
        B2(Things That Required Specialists)
    end

    A --> M1 & M2
    A --> B1 & B2
```

### Automation Eliminates People, Not Work

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Traditional Work
        T1(Task A) --> T2(Task B);
    end

    subgraph Automated Work
        A1(Task A is Automated);
    end

    T1 -- Introduces --> A1;
    A1 --> C{Does this eliminate work?};
    C -- No --> D[It frees up capacity to create NEW value];
    C -- Yes, for some --> E[It eliminates people UNWILLING to create new value];
