    title "Market Size Comparison (Annual)"
    x-axis "Market" [Worldwide SaaS, U.S. Labor]
    y-axis "Value (in Trillions USD)"
    bar [0.3, 13]
```

### The Evolution of Software's Role

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Traditional Software Model"
        direction TB
        A[Physical Records] -- Digitized into --> B(Database / System of Record);
        B -- "Is Read By" --> C((Human Worker));
        C -- "Performs" --> D[Task/Job];
    end

    subgraph "AI-Powered Software Model"
        direction TB
        E(AI System of Action) -- "Directly Performs" --> F[Task/Job];
    end
```

### The New Economic Formula: "Software Eats Labor"

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Capital] -- Invested in --> B[Companies];
    B -- Buys/Hires --> C["GPUs + Engineers + Coffee"];
    C -- Creates --> D[AI Software];
    D -- Performs/Replaces --> E[Labor];
```

### Changing the Software Business Model

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Old Model: Per-Seat"
        direction TB
        A[Price per Human User] --> B{AI makes humans more productive};
        B --> C[Companies need fewer users];
        C --> D((Revenue Decreases));
    end
    
    subgraph "New Model: Per-Outcome"
        direction TB
        E[Price based on job/outcome] --> F{AI performs the job directly};
        F --> G[Customers save on labor costs];
        G --> H((Vendor captures a fraction of savings, Revenue Increases));
    end
```

### How AI Expands the Addressable Market

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["<b>Previous State</b><br>CAC + COGS > LTV"] --> B[Business is not viable];
    C["<b>With AI</b><br>AI Sales Reps lower CAC<br>AI Operations lower COGS"] --> D["CAC + COGS < LTV"];
    D --> E[Business is now viable and scalable];
```

- CAC: Customer Acquisition Cost
- COGS: Cost of Goods Sold
- LTV: Lifetime Value
