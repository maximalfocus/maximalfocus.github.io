### 1. Human-in-the-Loop Design

```mermaid
graph TD
    propose["AI Agent Proposes Action"] --> review{"Human Review"};
    review -->|Accepts| execute["Action Executed"];
    review -->|Rejects/Corrects| learn["AI Learns from Correction"];
    learn --> propose;
    execute --> goal["System Goal Achieved"];
```

### 2. Memory as an Architectural Decision

*   **User level:** Preferences like chart types, writing tone.
*   **Team level:** Recurring queries, dashboards.
*   **Org level:** Institutional knowledge and policies.

```

### 3. Multi-Model Inference and Orchestration

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Query] --> B{Model Routing Logic};
    B -->|Simple Task & Low Cost| C[Smaller Model];
    B -->|Complex Task & Higher Cost| D[Advanced Model];
    B -->|High Latency Sensitivity| E[Fastest Model];
    C --> F[Response];
    D --> F;
    E --> F;
```

### 4. The Importance of Trust

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Trust] --> B[Consistent];
    A --> C[Explainable];
    A --> D[Auditable];
```
